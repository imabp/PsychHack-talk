## ðŸ‘‹ Hey there
Welcome to the **[PsychHack-talk](https://www.psych-hack.tech/)** repo.

### What is it?
This repository is being used at session for most of the events which involves portfolio building using **NextJS** and **Storyblok**
**Note**: As said, being used at session, it means, the name of the repo depends on the event, and hence,`[eventName]-talk` is the nomenclature.

You can find my upcoming events at [abirpal.dev](https://abirpal.dev) to keep track of my events.

- As this is only used for events and talks, introducing feature doesn't gurantee, if it will be merged or not, based on event nature and demand. 
Its recommended to avoid raising requests for new features  due to above reason.
